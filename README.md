# MADDE
> **M**ake **A**I **D**riven **D**evelopment **E**asier.

**MADDE** is a curated toolkit, workflow collection, and configuration set designed to minimize friction in AI-assisted software development.

The name comes from the Turkish word *"Madde"* (meaning **"Matter"** or **"Substance"**).
In the context of AI coding, **Context is the Matter.** This repository aims to provide the essential "matter" to your LLMs in the fastest, most efficient way possible.

## 🎯 The Mission
To bridge the gap between your local development environment and AI models. We focus on:
- Reducing context-switching fatigue.
- Automating the "context gathering" process.
- Sharing proven prompt engineering workflows.

## 🧰 Toolkit & Modules

### 1. [Local Context Ingester](./tools/gitingest-context-menu)
A seamless Windows integration for the popular `gitingest` tool. It allows you to convert any codebase into a single, LLM-ready text file directly from the Windows Context Menu (Right-Click), without ever touching the terminal.

*(More tools, editor configs, and prompt templates coming soon...)*

## 🤝 Contributing
If you have a script, a shortcut, or a workflow that speeds up your AI development cycle, feel free to contribute!
